# Student Attention Tracker
Since March 2020, our education turned to be a digital experience. Millions of students connected with their professors through applications as Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams. Even though, by studying online students already lose a great deal of the campus/school experience, educational systems around the Globe wanted to make sure that students get the best education from home. However, studying from the comfort of our home is not always the best idea. With distractions caused by social media, family, pets and food (yes, that fruit salad over the corner!), it is easy to lose focus from the lecture.

To allow students get the best from their online experience, I've created the Student Attention Tracker. Using models from Fast AI, I've trained a model to tell whether a student is paying attention from their camera. The model was trained with a large data-set of pictures of students taking attention on the class (having their eyes looking at a point on the screen), and students not taking attention (having eyes focused on a mobile phone, talking to another person, etc.)

The model was created during a Zindi Internship in December, 2020, using Python and FastAI Library.
